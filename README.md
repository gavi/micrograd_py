# micrograd_py
As part of watching the amazing video about micrograd from Karpathy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0), this is just a version that I created from memory, I peeked a few times at the original code when tests were failing (network not learning, silly mistake with the backward being assigned to `self` instead of `ret` object). The jupyter notebooks are used mostly for validation.
